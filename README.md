# NetwrixCoffee
Had issues with SQL Server install - unable to test if the set up was done correctly

SQL Scripts found in NetwrixCoffee/Sql/CreateCoffeeMachineDb.sql

If the SQL Connection Fails - uncomment line 29 in NetwrixCoffee/Startup.cs and it will run through the CoffeeMachineRecordMockService with seeded data
